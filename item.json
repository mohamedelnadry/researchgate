        "abstract": "Random constraint satisfaction problems exhibit several phase transitions when their density of constraints is varied. One of these threshold phenomena, known as the clustering or dynamic transition, corresponds to a transition for an information theoretic problem called tree reconstruction. In this article we study this threshold for two CSPs, nam..."
